            <strong>Hi. I'm Tiffany Deakin and I'm learning to be a web developer. 
                If you're reading this now, you'll see that I'm most certainly still learning. 
                However, if you check back in a few months, you'll see a lot of growth and progress... and much better code than you see now.
            </strong>

<!-- about me -->
    <section> 
        <h2 id="aboutMe">About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in central Illinois on a small diversified crop and livestock farm. After high school, I attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. After graduation, I took an involved role in my family's small business, <em>The Banner Sheep Magazine</em>, which is as it sounds, a magazine about sheep. We also manage a livestock auction company, and pre-COVID, designed websites for farmers. In taking this web development course, my aim is to apply knowledge and skills I learn to real life applications in my business.</p>
